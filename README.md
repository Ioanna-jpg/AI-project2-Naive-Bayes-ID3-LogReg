# AI-project2-Naive-Bayes-ID3-LogReg
This program classifies movies from the imdb dataset as positive/negative using machine learning algorithms. Then it produces learning curves and tables from the data produced. The 4 learning algorithms used: 1)Bernoulli Naive bayes 2) ID3 decision tree classifier 3) Logistic regression 4) Logistic regression by sklearn (for comparison purposes)
